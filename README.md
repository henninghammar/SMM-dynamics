# SMM Dynamics

This project is a collection of functions for running nonequilibrium Green's functions calculations and spin dynamics of a single-molecule magnet in a tunnel junction. It is a Matlab code and divided into several different projects.

## Structure of the project

The code is divided into the following folders:
* src - The source code for all calculations.
* plot - Different files to plot relevant characteristics.
* pulseswitching - Project folder to run code for a transient or a pulse over a SMM to calculate spin dynamics and currents in the system.
* heatflow - Project folder to run code for heat flow calculation in a SMM.
* LLGarticle - Project folder to compare different approximations for calculating dynamics of a SMM.

## Further reading and articles to cite

The published code is based on the calculations in the thesis [Dynamic of Magnetic Molecules under Electrical Control](http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1268379&dswid=-7793).
